//! Compiled BMC capability drivers and the platform rules that select them.
//!
//! # Where driver helpers live
//!
//! - Pure functions, which do no I/O, are free functions next to their
//!   callers, such as `bios::support::compare` or `dell::on_reset`.
//! - Standard Redfish resources any capability may reach, such as the selected
//!   system's URI, chassis, and BIOS attribute reads and writes, are methods
//!   of `resources::RedfishResourcesExt` on `OpCx`.
//! - Standard Redfish workflows one capability's drivers share are methods of
//!   that capability's `Redfish<Capability>Ext` trait in its `support.rs`,
//!   such as `power::support::RedfishPowerExt::force_off_and_wait`.
//! - Vendor-specific mechanics are free functions taking `cx` in the vendor's
//!   module, such as `dell::job_outcome(cx, response)` or
//!   `boot_order::lenovo::network_group_first(cx)`.
//! - A helper used by only one module is a private free function there.
